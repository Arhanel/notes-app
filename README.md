# Notes Web App – Multi-language Implementations

This repository contains the same simple notes application
created using different languages. The goal is to learn web development
and compare multiple implementations.

This is very simple project. I am learning everything basically from scratch.

For now the API and overall behavior is the same for every language.

## Current Implementations

- Node.js (Express) – `Nodejs/`
